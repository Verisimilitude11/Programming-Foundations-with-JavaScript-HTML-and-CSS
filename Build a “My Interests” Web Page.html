        Hi, I'm Piyush, a rising freshman at Interlake High School. I recently placed first in the U.S. Department of Energy's National Science Bowl which tests students' knowledge of chemistry, earth science, math, physics, and biology.

      I am highly passionate about advancing my skills in these fields as well as tying it with my passion for computer science. By continuing to do so, I will be able to apply what I have learned to make an impact on everyday lives.
