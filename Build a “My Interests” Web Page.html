        <p>
          Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyush-acharya/" >Piyush</a>, a rising freshman at Interlake High School. I recently placed first in the <em>U.S. Department of Energy's</em> <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-winners-32nd-annual-national-science-bowl">National Science Bowl</a> which tests students' knowledge of chemistry, earth science, math, physics, and biology.
        </p>

      <p>
        I am highly passionate about advancing my skills in these fields as well as tying it with my passion for computer science. By continuing to do so, I will be able to apply what I have learned to make an impact on everyday lives.
        </p>

      In my free time, I enjoy playing <b>tennis</b>, swimming, playing the piano, and biking with my family.
